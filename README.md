# Network Protocols, sans I/O

This repository is the source code to https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/.
That page is meant to document the various Python implementations of
network protocols that do not perform any I/O on their own. This is
considered the best way to implement network protocols going forward
for the Python community as it allows the protocol's use in either
synchronous or asynchronous code. See the web site or
[index.rst](https://github.com/brettcannon/sans-io/blob/master/index.rst)
for more details.
